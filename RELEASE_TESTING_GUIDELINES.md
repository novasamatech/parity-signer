### Unit Testing
Basically any method in `src/util` should be unit tested via Jest.

### E2E Testing (Ethereum Legacy)

1. Recover an account on Kovan with the phrase `this is sparta`
2. Go to `MyCrypto` and generate a transaction
3. Scan transaction QR
4. Scan the signature back to `MyCrypto`
5. Make sure the transaction actually succeeds
6. Go to `Sign a Message` tab in `MyCrypto` now
7. Type in a message, any message
8. Repeat steps 3, 4
9. Expect the message is readable just as you typed it in
10. Scan the signature back to `MyCrypto`
11. Verify the message

### E2E Testing (UOS)
There is currently no testnet, so we just check that the signature is formatted correctly. 

1. Clone  https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps
2. Disable the balance validation in apps, so you can construct an extrinsic with 0 balance
3. Choose Kusama network in Settings Tab
4. Do any extrinsic of your choice
5. Scan QR
6. Go to Settings, and change to Substrate (either the hosted Flaming Fir or a custom chain)
7. Run the same transaction
8. Expect the message: "Signer does not currently support a chain with the genesis hash: 0x....."
9. Go to `constants.js`
10. Add the appropriate genesis hash
11. Uncomment the checks for `isSubstrateDev` in `PayloadDetailsCard.js`
12. Repeat steps 4, 5
13. Expect the method decoding to be raw bytes.
