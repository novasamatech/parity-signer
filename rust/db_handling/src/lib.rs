//! This crate deals with standard database-related procedures used in
//! [Signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer) and Signer-supporting
//! ecosystem.  
//!
//! This crate:
//!
//! - contains helpers to operate the databases, used throughout Signer system
//! - generates cold (used in air-gapped Signer) and hot (used in
//! `generate_message` client) databases with default settings
//! - deals with taking data out of the database and putting the data in the
//! database
//! - contains Signer interface interactions, allowing exports of data to the
//! interface
//! - deals with address generation for Signer
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Feature `"signer"` corresponds to everything happening in Signer air-gapped
//! device.
//!
//! Feature `"active"` corresponds to all Signer-related things happening
//! **without** air-gap, including the generation of the database for Signer
//! during the build.
//!
//! Feature `"test"` includes both `"signer"` and `"active"` features, along
//! with some testing, and is the default one.
