//! This crate deals with standard database-related procedures used in
//! [Vault](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer) and Vault-supporting
//! ecosystem.  
//!
//! This crate:
//!
//! - contains helpers to operate the databases, used throughout Vault system
//! - generates cold (used in air-gapped Vault) and hot (used in
//! `generate_message` client) databases with default settings
//! - deals with taking data out of the database and putting the data in the
//! database
//! - contains Vault interface interactions, allowing exports of data to the
//! interface
//! - deals with address generation for Vault
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Feature `"active"` corresponds to all Vault-related things happening
//! **without** air-gap, including the generation of the database for Vault
//! during the build.
