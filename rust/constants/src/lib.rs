//! Constants used throughout in [Signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer)
//! and Signer-supporting ecosystem.  
//!
//! Signer uses **cold** database.
//!
//! The database used on a non air-gapper device for updates generation is
//! called **hot** database.
//!
//! Cold database is generated during the build, so it gets addressed both on
//! active and on signer side.
//!
//! Cold database contains following trees:
//!
//! - [`SPECSTREE`], with network specs in cold database format
//! - [`VERIFIERS`], with network verifiers, i.e. data on who user trusts to
//! sign updates for a given network
//! - [`METATREE`], with network metadata
//! - [`ADDRTREE`], with user addresses public information
//! - [`SETTREE`], containing general verifier, types information, and Signer
//! danger status
//! - [`TRANSACTION`], used to store temporarily transaction data while the
//! user accepts or declines it
//! - [`HISTORY`], with history log
//!
//! Hot database contains following trees:
//!
//! - [`SPECSTREEPREP`], with network specs in hot database format
//! - [`METATREE`], with network metadata, at most two versions for each network
//! - [`META_HISTORY`], with block hash at which the metadata was fetched
//! - [`ADDRESS_BOOK`], with network information needed to make RPC calls
//! - [`SETTREE`], containing types information
//!
//! Common constants are:
//!
//! - tree names in cold database alone or shared between cold and hot databases
//! - key names in [`SPECSTREE`] tree of cold database alone or shared between
//! cold and hot databases
//! - recurring throughout the Signer seed phrase for Alice
//! - QR graphic settings, used for both static and animated PNG QR codes
//!
//! # Features
//! Feature `"signer"` corresponds to everything related exclusively to Signer
//! air-gapped device. It includes:
//!
//! - keys for [`TRANSACTION`] tree, used for temporary storage for various
//! kinds of transactions while they are shown to user for approval
//! - display settings for history log and word guesser
//!
//! Feature `"active"` corresponds to all Signer-related things happening
//! exclusively **without** air-gap. It includes:
//!
//! - default database addresses for hot database and cold release database
//! - hot database specific tree names
//! - default color settings for network specs
//! - default files and folders name fragments, for use with `generate_message`
//! - fountain qr generation parameters (large apng fountain qr codes are
//! generated only on the hot side)
//!
//! Feature `"test"` includes all `"signer"` and `"active"` contents, and some
//! recurring data for integration testing, such as known identicons and known
//! export QR codes.
