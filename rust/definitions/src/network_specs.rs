//! Network specs, verifiers, and related types  
//!
//! Signer could be used only for networks introduced to the database.  
//!
//! Each network has associated set of parameters called here network specs.
//! Cold database stores [`NetworkSpecs`].  
//! Hot database stores [`NetworkSpecsToSend`]. Air-gap transfers with
//! `add_specs` payload also contain [`NetworkSpecsToSend`].
//! Network specs rarely change and are generally are introduced into
//! Signer only once for each network.
//!
//! Signer has verifier system storing public keys that Signer trusts are providing
//! correct updates to the information.  
//!
//! Cold database stores [`CurrentVerifier`] for each network and general verifier.  
//!
//! # Verifiers in cold database  
//!
//! Signer is expected to be safe to use as long as the information uploaded
//! into it through air-gap is the correct one.  
//!
//! Damaged network specs or network metadata could result in transactions
//! being parsed incorrectly.  
//!
//! Verifier system is introduced to have important transferable data signed
//! by a trusted party to exclude accidental or intentional errors. It is
//! especially important in keeping fast-changing network metadata updated.  
//!
//! ## Verifiers of data entering the Signer  
//!
//! The data scanned into Signer has an associated [`Verifier`].  
//!
//! If the information is verified, [`Verifier`] is `Some(VerifierValue)`.  
//!
//! If the information is not verified, [`Verifier`] is `None`.  
//!
//! Payloads with verified data contain trusted party public key and signature
//! for the data transferred, that are checked when the data is processed in
//! Signer. Unverified data gets processed as is, without any verification.
//! Unverified data should be used cautiously, and avoided unless absolutely
//! necessary.  
//!
//! [`VerifierValue`] is public key of the trusted party using a certain
//! encryption algorithm. At this moment, only `Standard` variant supporting
//! [`MultiSigner`](https://docs.rs/sp-runtime/6.0.0/sp_runtime/enum.MultiSigner.html)
//! is available.  
//!
//! ## Verifiers of data already in the Signer  
//!
//! There is [`CurrentVerifier`] for each network known to Signer, and
//! general verifier [`Verifier`] for some selected networks and for types.  
//!
//! ### Network verifiers  
//!
//! Each network in Signer has an associated [`CurrentVerifier`], having two
//! variants: `Valid` and `Dead`. Networks could be used by the Signer only if
//! their verifier is `CurrentVerifier::Valid` with associated
//! [`ValidCurrentVerifier`] value. Networks having `CurrentVerifier::Dead` no
//! longer could be used or updated, unless the Signer is completely wiped and
//! reset.  
//!
//! Network verifier information is stored in `VERIFIERS` tree of the cold
//! database, with [`VerifierKey`](crate::keyring::VerifierKey) in key form as
//! a key and encoded [`CurrentVerifier`] as a value. `VerifierKey` is derived
//! from network genesis hash. If the network supports more than one encryption
//! algorithm, network specs for all encryption algorithms and network metadata
//! would have the same [`CurrentVerifier`].  
//!
//! `ValidCurrentVerifier` has two variants: `General` and `Custom`.  
//!
//! `ValidCurrentVerifier::General` means that the network is verified by the
//! general verifier known to Signer. As installed or freshly wiped Signer
//! has default networks Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend having
//! `ValidCurrentVerifier::General`.  
//!
//! `ValidCurrentVerifier::Custom` means that the network is verified by
//! some `Verifier` other than the general verifier.  
//!
//! Updating network metadata could be done only if the metadata is signed by
//! exactly same [`CurrentVerifier`] as already recorded in the database for
//! this network.  
//!
//! The messages for updating network specs or loading network specs for same
//! network, but with different encryption algorithm, could be signed with
//! same [`CurrentVerifier`] or an upgraded one.  
//!
//! ### General verifier  
//!
//! General verifier is the default [`Verifier`] known to the Signer. It is the
//! data source the Signer relies upon the most.  
//!
//! General verifier is set up during Signer initialization, and is by
//! default Parity-associated key.  
//!
//! General verifier value is stored in `SETTREE` tree of the cold database
//! under key `GENERALVERIFIER`.  
//!
//! General verifier is used for verification of network specs and metadata
//! for some networks (ideally, the ones most used on particular Signer
//! device), and types information. Data previously verified by any
//! general verifier other than `None` could be updated only if the update
//! is signed by the same verifier. When general verifier is `None`, it gets
//! updated to [`Verifier`] of the first user-accepted verified updating payload
//! (i.e. with trust on first use).  
//!
//! Users can remove existing general verifier, this will re-initialize Signer
//! with general verifier set to `None` and reset the Signer data to defaults.  
//!
//! It is not recommended to use Signer without any general verifier, so it is
//! best to set up the user-trusted party as the general verifier right after
//! removing the old general verifier, by downloading and accepting some
//! trusted data with network specs or types information.  
//!
//! Note that setting general verifier from `None` to `Some(VerifierValue)`
//! will remove all previously known data (i.e. network specs, network metadata,
//! types information) associated with previous general verifier value `None`.
//! This is done to avoid false trust to data that appeared before the
//! verification began.  
//!
//! Note that if the network specs get removed due to general verifier change,
//! the addresses within this network are not deleted from the database, just
//! never displayed in the user interface. Signer will recall them if the
//! network specs get re-loaded verified with correct general verifier.  
//!
//! Let's consider a case when user has removed the default general verifier.
//! After the reset, general verifier value becomes `None`, however, the Signer
//! still has the network specs and metadata for default networks, and types
//! information. User plans to operate the Signer with Parity-unrelated network,
//! and loads verified network specs for it. The received data verifier becomes
//! the new general verifier, and the data for default networks and default
//! types gets removed.  
//!
//! ### Upgrading verifiers  
//!
//! Once `ValidCurrentVerifier::Custom` is set to `Some(VerifierValue)`, it
//! could not be changed to any other value except general verifier. Note that
//! in this case general verifier is also already set to `Some(VerifierValue)`,
//! since general verifier could not be `None` if there is not-`None` custom
//! verifier.  
//!
//! General verifier could not be changed once set up with `Some(VerifierValue)`,
//! unless the Signer is wiped and reset.  
//!
//! At the moment there is no mechanism allowing users to set up the verifiers
//! except by loading and accepting the updates signed by these verifiers.  
//!
//! In some cases network verifiers and general verifier could be changed
//! by accepting updating payloads:  
//!
//! - `ValidCurrentVerifier::General` with general verifier `None` could be
//! upgraded to `ValidCurrentVerifier::General` with general verifier
//! `(Some(VerifierValue))`. Happens when Signer with no value set up for
//! the general verifier receives and accepts a verified update with any
//! network specs or types.  
//!
//! - Network `ValidCurrentVerifier::Custom(Some(VerifierValue))` could be
//! upgraded to `ValidCurrentVerifier::General` with general verifier set to
//! `(Some(VerifierValue))`.
//! Happens when Signer receives and accepts network specs update verified
//! by general verifier for this network. Note: metadata update with
//! verifier upgrade would be rejected.  
//!
//! - Network `ValidCurrentVerifier::Custom(None)` could be upgraded to
//! `ValidCurrentVerifier::General` with general verifier set to
//! `(Some(VerifierValue))`.
//! Happens when Signer receives and accepts network specs update verified
//! by general verifier for this network. Note: metadata update with
//! verifier upgrade would be rejected.  
//!
//! If [`CurrentVerifier`] upgrade occurs, all pre-upgrade network information
//! is wiped (Signer warns about that).  
//!
//! If general verifier upgrade occurs, all pre-upgrade information verified
//! by the general verifier is wiped (Signer warns about that).  
//!
//! ### Deleting network specs  
//!
//! User can remove any network from Signer. "Remove network" means removing:
//! - all network specs associated with network genesis hash,
//! - all metadata associated with network specs name,
//! - all addresses within this network with any encryption,
//! - (possibly) modifying [`CurrentVerifier`].  
//!
//! If the network was verified by `CurrentVerifier::Valid` with value
//! `ValidCurrentVerifier::General`, verifier information in [`CurrentVerifier`]
//! will not change. Restoring the network will require updates signed by the
//! same general verifier as before.  
//!
//! If the network was verified by `CurrentVerifier::Valid` with value
//! `ValidCurrentVerifier::Custom` and the custom [`Verifier`] was `None`, no
//! changes will happen, network verifier will stay
//! `CurrentVerifier::Valid(ValidCurrentVerifier::Custom(None))`. Otherwise,
//! the network verifier will be changed to `CurrentVerifier::Dead`, and it
//! would be impossible to use the network again unless the Signer is wiped.
//! This is a part of security policy.  
//!
//! # Network specs in cold database
//!
//! [`NetworkSpecs`] are stored in `SPECSTREE` tree of the cold database,
//! with [`NetworkSpecsKey`] in key form as a key and SCALE-encoded [`NetworkSpecs`]
//! as a value.  
//!
//! [`NetworkSpecs`] include both the `encryption` ([`Encryption`]) and network  
//! genesis hash (`[u8; 32]`), that are used for [`NetworkSpecsKey`] generation.  
//! [`NetworkSpecs`] retrieved for given [`NetworkSpecsKey`] always get checked
//! for consistency.  
//!
//! If the network supports more than one encryption algorithm, each encryption
//! corresponds to different [`NetworkSpecsKey`], and any or all of them could be
//! coexisting in Signer simultaneously.  
//!
//! [`NetworkSpecs`] are generally expected to remain unchanged over time.  
//!
//! ## Adding new network specs  
//!
//! New networks could be added to Signer through scanning `add_specs` QR code
//! for the network.
//!
//! ## Updating network specs (replacing old ones with new ones without deleting
//! old ones)
//!
//! Signer will not allow to update network specs if critical parameters
//! have changed.  
//! These critical parameters are:  
//! - `base58prefix`, network-associated base58 prefix  
//! - `decimals`  
//! - `name`, network name, as it appears in the network metadata  
//! - `unit`  
//!
//! However, if non-critical parameters have changes, Signer will permit the
//! network specs updating.  
//! These non-critical parameters are:  
//! - `color`  
//! - `logo`, network-associated logo picture  
//! - `path_id`, default address derivation path for the network  
//! - `secondary_color`  
//! - `title`, network title, as it is displayed in Signer  
//!
//! Some quickly updating experimental networks are changing the genesis hash
//! often. Network genesis hash participates in [`NetworkSpecsKey`]
//! generation. This way, if the genesis hash got updated, the network would
//! appear "unknown" to Signer, and to use it, network specs with new genesis hash
//! would have to be added. Adding network specs with new genesis hash does not
//! require deleting network specs with old genesis hash.  
//!
//! ## Deleting network specs
//!
//! Any network could be removed, however sometimes there are associated changes
//! in corresponding verifier. See above.
//!
//! ## Balance representation: decimals and units  
//!
//! To represent the balance-related values properly, each network has associated
//! decimals and units. The balance-related values in, for example, transactions
//! are integer numbers, and are formatted properly only during the transactions
//! decoding. For this `decimals` and `unit` values from [`NetworkSpecs`] are used.
//! `decimals` indicate the order of magnitude, by which the token `unit`
//! exceeds the integer representing unit (see examples below).
//! Both `decimals` and `unit` values could be queried through RPC calls for each
//! Signer-compatible network.  
//! Sometimes the networks have several available decimals and units, or none at all.  
//! This cases should be dealt with on case-by-case basis.  
//!
//! ## Examples: balance representation  
//!
//! Balance (`u64`) from transaction is decoded as `1`.
//! Network `decimals` value is `12`, network `unit` is `WND`.
//! The balance should be therefore represented as `1 pWND`.  
//!
//! Balance (`u64`) from transaction is decoded as `10000000`.
//! Network `decimals` value is `12`, network `unit` is `WND`.
//! The balance should be therefore represented as `10 uWND`.
