//! Address key associated non-secret information stored in Signer database
//!
//! Signer database has a tree `ADDRTREE` with [`AddressKey`] in key form
//! as a key and encoded [`AddressDetails`] as a value.
//! [`AddressDetails`] contains non-secret information associated with address key.  
//!
//! `ADDRTREE` is operated mainly from within the Signer.
//!
//! Release and test versions of the cold database are generated on the Active side.
