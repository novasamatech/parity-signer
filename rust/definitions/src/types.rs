//! Types description needed to decode transactions generated with
//! [`RuntimeMetadata`](https://docs.rs/frame-metadata/15.0.0/frame_metadata/enum.RuntimeMetadata.html)
//! `V12` and `V13`
//!
//! Prior to `V14`, metadata did not contain information on *what* the type used
//! in the transaction actually is, it had only the type name.
//! For common types (i.e the ones encountered in network Westend, Polkadot,
//! Kusama, and Rococo) the type information was found elsewhere, and is a part of
//! existing Signer defaults.  
//!
//! [`TypeEntry`] is used to store the type information. Default types set contains [`TypeEntry`]
//! data for common types, and is stored in `SETTREE` tree of both hot and cold databases
//! with key `TYPES`.  
//!
//! For transaction with runtime metadata `V12` or `V13` to be decoded each of the
//! encountered types must have a corresponding [`TypeEntry`] or be transformable into a type
//! having [`TypeEntry`].  
//!
//! With `V14` release this module became obsolete, however, since not all networks are yet on `V14`
//! metadata, it remains here.
