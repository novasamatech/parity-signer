//! Errors occuring in Signer
//!
//! Signer works with cold database only.
//!
//! All errors [`ErrorSigner`] could be displayed to user:
//! - as part of card set, generated during transaction parsing  
//! - as individual text errors through `Error` modal in `navigator`
//! - as `anyhow` errors produced by the Signer device
//!
//! For all this, the text representation of the error is needed. Error text
//! must clearly indicate what happened and what user can try to do to fix the
//! issue. Error wording must be yet polished extensively.
//!
//! This module gathers all possible [`ErrorSigner`] errors in one place, so that
//! error management is easier.

/// - `53xx03` text message transactions
///
/// `53xx00` and `53xx02` transactions contain encoded transaction data, and

/// generated in client, for certain address and within certain network.
/// To parse the transaction and to generate the signature, Signer must
/// have the network information (network specs and correct network metadata)
/// and the public address-associated information in its database.
///
/// `53xx00` and `53xx02` transcations consist of:
///
/// - prelude, `53xx00` or `53xx02`, where `xx` stands for the encryption
/// algorithm associated with address and network used
/// - public key corresponding to the address that can sign the transaction
/// - encoded call data, the body of the transaction
/// - extensions, as set in the network metadata
/// - genesis hash of the network in which the transaction was generated
///
/// Parsing process first separates the prelude, public key, genesis hash and
/// the combined call + extensions data.
///
/// The call information is SCALE-encoded into `Vec<u8>` bytes and then those
/// bytes are SCALE-encoded again, so that the call data contained in the
/// transaction consists of `compact` with encoded call length in bytes
/// followed by the `Vec<u8>` with the encoded data.
///
/// Call and extensions are cut based on the call length declared at the start
/// of the combined call + extensions data.
///
/// Then the extensions are decoded, and it is checked that the metadata version
/// in extensions coincides with the metadata version used for the decoding.
///
/// Decoding the extensions for metadata with `RuntimeMetadataV12` or
/// `RuntimeMetadataV13` is using a static set of extensions, namely:
///
/// - [`Era`](https://docs.rs/sp-runtime/6.0.0/sp_runtime/generic/enum.Era.html)
/// - nonce, compact `u64`
/// - transaction tip, compact `u128`
/// - metadata version, `u32`
/// - tx version, `u32`
/// - network genesis hash, `[u8; 32]`
/// - block hash, `[u8; 32]`
///
/// Decoding the extensions for metadata with `RuntimeMetadataV14` uses
/// dynamically acquired set of extensions from the metadata itself.
///
/// After the extensions, the call data itself is decoded using the network
/// metadata. Each call first byte is the index of the pallet.
///
/// Metadata with `RuntimeMetadataV12` or `RuntimeMetadataV13` has only type
/// names associated with call arguments. Signer finds what the types really
/// are and how to decode them by using the types information that must be in
/// Signer database.
/// For `RuntimeMetadataV12` or `RuntimeMetadataV13` the second byte in call is
/// the index of the method within the pallet, and thes Signer finds the types
/// used by the method and proceeds to decode the call data piece by piece.
///
/// Metadata with `RuntimeMetadataV14` has types data in-built in the metadata
/// itself, and the types needed to decode the call are resolved during the
/// decoding. For `RuntimeMetadataV14` the second byte in call is also
/// the index of the method within the pallet, but this already goes into the
/// type resolver.
///
/// Calls may contain nested calls, for `RuntimeMetadataV12` or
/// `RuntimeMetadataV13` metadata the call decoding always starts with pallet
/// and method combination processing. For `RuntimeMetadataV14` metadata the
/// nested calls are processed through the type resolver, i.e. the pallet index
/// is processed independently only on the start of the decoding.
///
/// `53xx03` transaction consists of:
///
/// - prelude `53xx03`, where `xx` stands for the encryption algorithm
/// associated with address and network used
/// - public key corresponding to the address that can sign the transaction
/// - SCALE-encoded `String` contents of the message
/// - genesis hash of the network in which the transaction was generated
///
/// Signer assumes that every byte of the transaction will be processed, and
/// shows an error if this is not the case.
