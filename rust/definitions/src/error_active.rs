//! Errors occuring on the active side, i.e. while operating `generate_message`
//! client
//!
//! Active side deals with both preparation of cold database that would be
//! loaded in Signer on build and with hot database operations. Cold database
//! could be the *release* cold database (the actual one for Signer build) or
//! the *test* cold database (with test Alice identities, used for tests).
//!
//! All errors [`ErrorActive`] could be displayed to user as error messages in
//! `generate_message` client, and are implementing `Display` trait.
//!
//! Exact error wording will be refined eventually.
//!
//! This module gathers all possible [`ErrorActive`] errors in one place, so that
//! error management is easier.
