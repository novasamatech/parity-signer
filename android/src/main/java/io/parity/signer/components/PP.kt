## Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing

Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your data for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented unless there is no other legal ground for the processing.

- Any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries for :
  - website maintenance and security; and
  - recruitment and hiring
- Selected third parties including but not limited to:
  - business partners and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;
  - our newsletter service provider for the purposes of providing you with our newsletter;

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA (in our case the US) who works for us or for one of our suppliers.

Where information is transferred outside the EEA, and where this is to a stakeholder or vendor in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to admin@parity.io.

Our Sites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

## Your rights

You have the right to **ask us for a copy** of your personal data; to **correct**, **delete** or **restrict** (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to **obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format**, and to ask us to **share (port) this data to another controller**.

In addition, you can **object to the processing** of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement).

These **rights may be limited**, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in the GDPR. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.

To exercise any of these rights, or to obtain other information, such as a copy of a legitimate interests balancing test, you can get in touch with us using the details set out under the Section “**Contact**” below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the **right to complain** to an EU data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at admin@parity.io.

## Which entity is my data controller, and which affiliates might my data be shared with?

The data controller for your information is Parity Technologies Limited of c/o IGNITION LAW Moray House, Floor 1, Moray House, 23-31 Great Titchfield Street, London, United Kingdom, WC1W 7PA.

Your data might be shared with our group company Parity Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Glogauer Str. 6, 10999, Berlin, Germany for recruiting purposes and for the management of group functions.
How long will you retain my data?

Where you are a contributor, customer or a registered user, we will keep your information for the duration of any contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the extent permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform the purposes set out in this notice.

Where we process personal data with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future.

For data about your visits to our Sites and where we process personal data for Sites security purposes, we will retain this data for 12 months following your last visit of our Sites.

Data you provided to us in the course of your job application will be kept for 6 months, if your application was not successful. If you enter in an employment relationship with us, the relevant information will be kept for the duration of the employment contract as part of your personnel file.


Laws may require us to hold certain information for specific periods. In other cases, we may retain data for an appropriate period after any relationship with you ends to protect itself from legal claims, or to administer its business.

## How you protect my data

We strive to maintain the highest standards of security and Parity has put in place robust technical and organizational measures for the protection of your data in accordance with the current, general state of the art technologies, especially to protect the data against loss, falsification or access by unauthorized third persons. However the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. So, whilst we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal data we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

## Cookie-policy

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by the websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. The use of cookies is now standard for most websites. If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, you can manage and control them through your browser, including removing cookies by deleting them from your ‘browser history’ (cache) when you leave the site. See the subsection “How to manage cookies” for further information

## Necessary cookies

The law states that we can store cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site. To set all other types of cookies we need your permission. Necessary cookies help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.

## Parity Technologies’ use of cookies

The only cookie set on Parity Technologies’ websites is the "cfduid" cookie. This cookie is set by a third party, CloudFlare (a content delivery network service), and is necessary for the website to function properly as it is used to identify trusted web traffic. It does not correspond to any user ID in the web application, nor does the cookie store any personally identifiable information. In addition, it’s a “first-party” cookie bound to Parity’s hostname and not accessible from anywhere else, which makes it unusable for tracking purposes. Where technically possible it is also marked as “Secure” which would only allow its transmission over encrypted channels. [https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-CloudFlare-cfduid-cookie-do-](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-CloudFlare-cfduid-cookie-do-)

This cookie expires after 1 year.

You can enable or disable cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. You can also find out how to do this, and find more information on cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org. However, if you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you may be unable to complete certain activities on our Sites or to correctly access certain parts of it.
