**PARITY SIGNER MOBILE APPLICATION - END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT**

**Parity Technologies Limited** is a company registered in England and Wales under company number 09760015, with its registered office at c/o Ignition Law, 1 Sans Walk, London, England, EC1R 0LT ("**Parity**"). Parity operates this Parity Signer mobile application (the "**App**").

In this document, when we refer to "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**", we mean Parity; and when we refer to "**you**" or "**your**" we mean you, the person downloading, accessing and/or using the App.

**1.  Understanding these terms**

  1.1  This end user license agreement together with appendix 1 to it and our instructions referred to in it (this "**EULA**") describes how you may download the App and access and/or use the App. By downloading, accessing and/or using the App, this EULA will apply to you and you agree to the terms of this EULA. You should therefore read the terms carefully before downloading, accessing and/or using the App. If any written instruction we have given you is inconsistent with the terms set out in this document, you should comply with our instructions and in doing so you will not be in breach of the inconsistent term of this document.

  1.2  When certain words and phrases are used in this EULA, they have specific meanings (these are known as "**defined terms**"). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of this EULA where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in brackets and speech marks).

  1.3  In order to access and/or use the App it must be downloaded on to a smartphone or other mobile device running either the iOS or Android operating systems (the device you use, "**Device**"). In order to download the App, you will need Internet access.

  1.4  Please note that:

  1.4.1  to download the App, you must also review and agree to the additional app terms set out in appendix 1 to this EULA and any other terms and conditions imposed by the app store from which you have downloaded the App; and

  1.4.2  we will not collect any personal information from or in relation to you, including from your downloading, accessing and/or use of the App. If you contact us, we only use your personal information in accordance with our privacy policy (available at [*www.parity.io/privacy*](www.parity.io/privacy)).

**2.  The App**

  2.1  Subject to the terms of this EULA, the App is made available to you free of charge. The App does not connect to any computer system (other than the Device on which you install it) and does not gather or transmit to us or any other person any data in relation to you or your use of the App.

  2.2  You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to and use of the App. You should not allow any other person to access and/or use the App on your Device.

  2.3  The App and the content on it are provided for general information purposes only. They are not intended to amount to advice on which you should rely.

  2.4  You may only access and/or use the App for your own domestic, private and non-commercial use.

  2.5  Subject to clause 2.6, the App (once downloaded on to a Device in accordance with this EULA) is designed to enable you to:

  2.5.1  generate private keys using a recovery phrase ("**Private Key(s**)") and a corresponding public key and store them on such Device;

  2.5.2  verify and sign transactions on Blockchains (as defined below) using the relevant Private Key ("**Digital Signature**"); and

  2.5.3  when used in conjunction with certain Third Party Services (which are defined in clause 4.3), can be used to broadcast transactions on the relevant Blockchains,

(the "**App** **Functionality**").

  2.6  The App Functionality the App, can only be used on the Ethereum public blockchain protocol, blockchain protocols built on our "Substrate" technology, including Kusama and Polkadot, and other blockchain protocols as are indicated within the App itself ("**Blockchain(s)**"). You are responsible for your choice of and interaction with the relevant Blockchain.

  2.7  The App is not itself part of any blockchain. For this reason, we will have no liability to you in relation to any activity on any blockchain or the performance or availability of any blockchain. In addition, we do not guarantee that a Digital Signature will result in the related transaction being recorded on the relevant Blockchain. You are responsible for ensuring that any transactions you broadcast, or Digital Signatures you create, conform to the applicable rules of the relevant Blockchain.

  2.8  You should only download, access and/or use the App if you are familiar with interacting with the Blockchains. We recommend you learn about and understand the basics of the Blockchains in connection with which you intend to use the App before downloading, accessing and/or using the App.

  2.9  The purpose of the App is to provide the App Functionality on a Device which is not connected to any form network or the internet. The App should only ever be used on an offline Device. Once you have downloaded, installed and set up the App on the Device, it is very important that you follow the instructions we provide on our website (available at [https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer)) to ensure the Device is not connected to any network or the internet.

  2.10  You are responsible for the use and security of any Device on which you have installed the App. We will have no liability to you for any losses or damages you incur in respect of (i) access and/or use of the App (including the creation of any Digital Signature or loss of Private Keys) as a result of unauthorised persons gaining access to your Device; or (ii) your Device being compromised or corrupted.

**3.  Your account and password**

  3.1  You will need to register an account on the App in order to make full use of the App ("**Account**"). If you register an Account, you will be asked to provide certain information (such as your email address) and to create a pin code and a seed recovery phrase, as part of our security procedures. The information relating to your Account is never transmitted to us. You must treat such pin code and recovery phrase as confidential and you must not disclose it to any third party. Your recovery phrase is used to generate your Private Key, so if you lose your recovery phase, you will not be able to regenerate your Private Key to recover your Account. This may mean you are unable to access any digital currency, token and cryptocurrency associated with such Private Keys and/or create any Digital Signatures. You should ensure that you have taken appropriate steps to securely back-up any of your data stored on your Device (including the recovery phrase and Private Keys) so that such data is accessible in these circumstances.

  3.2  You are responsible for any unauthorised access and/or use of your App or Account login details.

**4.  Acceptable use**

This right does not apply to the Parity name and mark, the Parity Signer product names, and any texts, designs, graphics, photographs and images contained in the App, which you are not entitled to use (other than through the use of the App on your Device in accordance with this EULA) or modify in any circumstances . We reserve all other rights.

  5.2  We are the owner or licensee of all intellectual property rights in the App and its content, the Parity name and mark and Parity Signer product names and images. Those works are protected by intellectual property laws and treaties around the world. All such rights are reserved.

  6.1  Nothing in this EULA excludes or limits our liability for:

  6.1.1  death or personal injury caused by our negligence;

  6.1.2  fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; and

  6.1.3  any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability.

  6.2  The App is built on open source software and made available in accordance with this agreement as an open source community project. Accordingly, we make the App (and both the source code and object code in it) available on an "as is" basis. This means that we cannot guarantee or warrant to you that the App is free from errors or defects.

  6.3  It is possible that as a result of an error or defect the version of the App stored on your Device may become corrupt and unusable so that it may not be possible to retrieve the data stored on it (including any Private Keys). You should ensure that you have taken appropriate steps to securely back-up any of your data (including any Private Keys) stored on your Device so that it is not lost in these circumstances. Save if we cause damage to your Device or other digital content and such damage would not have occurred if we had exercised reasonable care and skill, as the App is free for you to access and/or use and we receive no data in relation to you from your use of it, we will not be liable to you in any way if the App stops working properly or at all, including where any data stored in the App is lost or corrupted.

  6.4  Nothing in this EULA affects your statutory rights. Advice about your statutory rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office.

  6.5  We only supply the App for domestic and private use. You agree not to use the App, or any content on the App, for any commercial or business purposes and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

**8.  Changes to this EULA**

  8.1  We may make changes to the terms of this EULA from time to time (if, for example, there is a change in the law that means we need to change this EULA). Please check this EULA (at the address indicated in clause 1.1) regularly to ensure that you understand the up-to-date terms that apply at the time that you access and use the App. If we update the terms of this EULA, the updated terms will apply 10 days after the update is posted (at the address indicated in clause 1.1) to each of your uses of the App from that point on.

  8.2  From time to time updates to the App may be issued through the relevant app store. As the App is designed to operate on a Device which remains offline, you agree that it is your responsibility to check whether we have published any updates to the App. You should carry out this check on a device on which the App has not been installed and follow our instructions (available at [https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer)) as to how to update the App.

  8.3  You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owners of any Devices that are controlled, but not owned, by you to download a copy of the App onto the Devices. You and they may be charged by your and their service providers for Internet access on the Devices. You accept responsibility in accordance with the terms of this EULA for the use of the App in relation to any Device, whether or not it is owned by you.

**9.  Other important information**

  9.1  Each of the clauses of this EULA operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and effect.

  9.2  If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

  9.3  If you wish to have more information on online dispute resolution, please follow this link to the website of the European Commission: [*http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/*](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). This link is provided as required by Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, for information purposes only. We are not obliged to participate in online dispute resolution.

**10.  Governing law and jurisdiction**

  10.1  This EULA is governed by English law. This means that your download, access to, and use of, the App, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection therewith will be governed by English law.

  10.2  You can bring proceedings in respect of this EULA in the English courts. However, as a consumer, if you live in another European Union member state you can bring legal proceedings in respect of this EULA in either the English courts or the courts of that Member State.

  10.3  As a consumer, if you are resident in the European Union and we direct this App to the member state in which you are resident, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in this EULA, including clause 10.1, affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.
