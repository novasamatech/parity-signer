In addition, you can **object to the processing** of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement).

These **rights may be limited**, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in the GDPR. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.

You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at admin@parity.io.

## Which entity is my data controller, and which affiliates might my data be shared with?

The data controller for your information is Parity Technologies Limited of c/o IGNITION LAW Moray House, Floor 1, Moray House, 23-31 Great Titchfield Street, London, United Kingdom, WC1W 7PA.

Your data might be shared with our group company Parity Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Glogauer Str. 6, 10999, Berlin, Germany for recruiting purposes and for the management of group functions.
How long will you retain my data?

Where you are a contributor, customer or a registered user, we will keep your information for the duration of any contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the extent permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform the purposes set out in this notice.

Where we process personal data with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future.

For data about your visits to our Sites and where we process personal data for Sites security purposes, we will retain this data for 12 months following your last visit of our Sites.

Data you provided to us in the course of your job application will be kept for 6 months, if your application was not successful. If you enter in an employment relationship with us, the relevant information will be kept for the duration of the employment contract as part of your personnel file.


Laws may require us to hold certain information for specific periods. In other cases, we may retain data for an appropriate period after any relationship with you ends to protect itself from legal claims, or to administer its business.

## How you protect my data

We strive to maintain the highest standards of security and Parity has put in place robust technical and organizational measures for the protection of your data in accordance with the current, general state of the art technologies, especially to protect the data against loss, falsification or access by unauthorized third persons. However the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. So, whilst we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal data we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

## Cookie-policy

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by the websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. The use of cookies is now standard for most websites. If you are uncomfortable with the use of cookies, you can manage and control them through your browser, including removing cookies by deleting them from your ‘browser history’ (cache) when you leave the site. See the subsection “How to manage cookies” for further information

## Necessary cookies

The law states that we can store cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site. To set all other types of cookies we need your permission. Necessary cookies help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.

## Parity Technologies’ use of cookies

The only cookie set on Parity Technologies’ websites is the "cfduid" cookie. This cookie is set by a third party, CloudFlare (a content delivery network service), and is necessary for the website to function properly as it is used to identify trusted web traffic. It does not correspond to any user ID in the web application, nor does the cookie store any personally identifiable information. In addition, it’s a “first-party” cookie bound to Parity’s hostname and not accessible from anywhere else, which makes it unusable for tracking purposes. Where technically possible it is also marked as “Secure” which would only allow its transmission over encrypted channels. [https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-CloudFlare-cfduid-cookie-do-](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-CloudFlare-cfduid-cookie-do-)

This cookie expires after 1 year.
