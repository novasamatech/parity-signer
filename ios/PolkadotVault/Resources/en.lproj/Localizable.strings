For password-derived accounts, the password is applied on the derivation path. You can know the mnemonic phrase and the derivation path, but without the password it is not possible to access the account. In mathematical terms, if we have a written derivation path and a password, we can calculate the real derivation path as f(written derivation path, password); where f is a function. We can then calculate the account key pair using f(seed, real derivation path).
